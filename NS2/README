How to run

ns ns2.tcl <TCP version> <Test case number 1/2/3>

Run the above command to start the simulation of created network
----------------------------------------------------------------

Code structure

The code first takes the tcp version and test case number as input argument. There are 
2 different function which are written in the TCL file. 

record process
finish process

The record process takes the input parameters of incoming bytes in every 1 second, dumps
them into the output trace file. This file is used by the xgraph to plot the output curve.
After this we create the network topology, create the two routers R1 and R2 and connect them with 
1mbps link. Similarly other nodes are created and their link speeds are specified based on the test case.
This process keeps reocrding the data ecery 1 second.

Then at the end of 400 seconds, finish process is called. We also display the total throughput acheived in 
this time and amount of data sent on both links.

We start sending the data at 1 second, start record process at 100 second and then end the simulaton at 400 second.
